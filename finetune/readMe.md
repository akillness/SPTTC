## Fine-tune a pretrained model

> Introduction : <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/training>

There are significant benefits to using a pretrained model. It reduces computation costs, your carbon footprint, and allows you to use state-of-the-art models without having to train one from scratch. ðŸ¤— Transformers provides access to thousands of pretrained models for a wide range of tasks. When you use a pretrained model, you train it on a dataset specific to your task. This is known as fine-tuning, an incredibly powerful training technique. In this tutorial, you will fine-tune a pretrained model with a deep learning framework of your choice:

- Fine-tune a pretrained model with ðŸ¤— Transformers [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer).
- Fine-tune a pretrained model in TensorFlow with Keras.
- Fine-tune a pretrained model in native PyTorch.
